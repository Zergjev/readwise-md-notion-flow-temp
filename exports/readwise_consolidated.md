## The School of Life — The School of Life and Alain de Botton
*Category:* books
- Much anxiety surrounds the question of how good the next generation will be at maths; very little around their abilities at marriage or kindness. We devote inordinate hours to learning about tectonic plates and cloud formations, and relatively few fathoming shame and rage. The assumption is that emotional insight might be either unnecessary or in essence unteachable, lying beyond reason or method, an unreproducible phenomenon best abandoned to individual instinct and intuition. We are left to find our own path around our unfeasibly complicated minds – a move as striking (and as wise) as suggesting that each generation should rediscover the laws of physics by themselves. _(loc 245)_
  
  ↳ **Note:** Why, from a philosophical point of view, or even a broader epistemic reflection, would we not consider these aspects of human Knokwledge, worthy of curricular inclusion, of academic programming, beyond its highly specific niche within superior education at the technical or university level and secluded within a School or Department of Psychology or Psychiatry? Does it requiere all previous learned knowledge to be studied? Is it postponed based on relevance ? Appropriate Age for studying it? Complexity? Maturity levels?

## Buddhism Without Beliefs — Stephen Batchelor
*Category:* supplementals
- Self-confidence is not a form of arrogance. It is trust in our capacity to awaken. It is both the courage to face whatever life throws at us without losing equanimity, and the humility to treat every situation we encounter as one from which we can learn.
- Dharma practice is founded on resolve. This is not an emotional conversion, a devastating realization of the error of our ways, a desperate urge to be good, but an ongoing, heartfelt reflection on priorities, values, and purpose. We need to keep taking stock of our life in an unsentimental, uncompromising way. _(loc 1)_
- Agnosticism is no excuse for indecision. If anything, it is a catalyst for action; for in shifting concern away from a future life and back to the present, it demands an ethics of empathy rather than a metaphysics of fear and hope. _(loc 2)_
- Letting go of a craving is not rejecting it but allowing it to be itself: a contingent state of mind that once arisen will pass away. _(loc 3)_
- We do not receive wisdom, we must discover it for ourselves, after a journey through the wilderness, which no one else can make for us, which no one can spare us, for our wisdom is the point of view from which we come at last to regard the world. _(loc 4)_
- To understand a worry is to know it calmly and clearly for what it is: transient, contingent, and devoid of intrinsic identity. _(loc 5)_
- The challenge of the first truth is to act before habitual reactions incapacitate us. _(loc 6)_
- The task of awareness is to catch the impulse at its inception, to notice the very first hint of resentment coloring our feelings and perceptions. But such precision requires a focused mind. _(loc 7)_
- The four ennobling truths are not propositions to believe; they are challenges to act. _(loc 8)_
- ANGUISH EMERGES FROM craving for life to be other than it is. _(loc 9)_
- Dharma practice starts not with belief in a transcendent reality but through embracing the anguish experienced in an uncertain world. _(loc 10)_
- Anguish emerges from craving for life to be other than it is. It is the symptom of flight from birth and death, from the pulse of the present. It is the gnawing mood of unease that haunts the clinging to “me” and “mine.” _(loc 11)_
- Integrity entails not merely refraining from overt acts of this kind, but also recognizing how we contemplate such behavior in our thoughts, repeat it through fantasy, or prepare for it even though we lose our nerve before carrying it out. _(loc 12)_
- Over time such meditation penetrates our primary sense of being in the world at all. It helps us value more deeply our relationships with others, whom we come to regard as transient as ourselves. It evokes the poignancy implicit in the transitoriness of all things. _(loc 13)_
- A compassionate heart still feels anger, greed, jealousy, and other such emotions. But it accepts them for what they are with equanimity, and cultivates the strength of mind to let them arise and pass without identifying with or acting upon them. _(loc 14)_
- One of the great realizations of the Enlightenment was that an atheistic materialist could be just as moral a person as a believer—even more so. This insight led to liberation from the constraints of ecclesiastical dogma, which was crucial in forming the sense of intellectual and political freedom we enjoy today. _(loc 15)_
- THE ACTIONS THAT accompany the four truths describe the trajectory of dharma practice: understanding anguish leads to letting go of craving, which leads to realizing its cessation, which leads to cultivating the path. _(loc 16)_
- A REFLECTION LIKE this does not tell you anything you do not already know: that death is certain and its time uncertain. The point is to consider these facts regularly and slowly, allowing them to percolate through you, until a felt-sense of their meaning and implication is awakened. _(loc 17)_
- Awakening is no longer seen as something to attain in the distant future, for it is not a thing but a process—and this process is the path itself. _(loc 18)_
- I may be able to ease the spasm of self-centeredness by realizing that I am not a fixed essence but an interactive cluster of processes. _(loc 19)_

- THE FORCE OF the term “agnosticism” has been lost. It has come to mean: not to hold an opinion about the questions of life and death; to say “I don’t know” when you really mean “I don’t want to know.” When allied (and confused) with atheism, it has become part of the attitude that legitimizes an indulgent consumerism and the unreflective conformism dictated by mass media. _(loc 276)_
  
  ↳ **Note:** Thinking bout this "not wantikng to know" here byh the author but then contrzted with the version that Huxley offered, seems to me that it is not an "I don't want to know" as a resignation to knokwledge but exactly the opposite, "I want to know, but to know I need understanding and proof, so I can explain to another what I know"

## Essays in Love — Alain de Botton
*Category:* supplementals
- The most attractive are not those who allow us to kiss them at once (we soon feel ungrateful) or those who never allow us to kiss them (we soon forget them), but those who know how carefully to administer varied doses of hope and despair.
- Perhaps it is true that we do not really exist until there is someone there to see us existing, we cannot properly speak until there is someone there who can understand what we are saying, in essence, we are not wholly alive until we are loved. _(loc 1)_
- It is no wonder that the concept of a God who can see us has been central to many religions: to be seen is to be assured that we exist, all the better if one is dealing with a God (or partner) who loves us. _(loc 2)_
- Lovers cannot remain philosophers for long, they should give way to the religious impulse, which is to believe and have faith, as opposed to the philosophic impulse, which is to doubt and enquire. They should prefer the risk of being wrong and in love to being in doubt and without love. _(loc 3)_
- One has to go into relationships with equal expectations, ready to give as much as the other – not with one person wanting a fling and the other real love. I think that’s where all the agony comes from.’ _(loc 4)_
- We might define maturity as the ability to give everyone what they deserve when they deserve it, to separate the emotions that belong and should be restricted to oneself from those that should at once be expressed to their initiators rather than passed on to later and more innocent arrivals. We were often not mature. _(loc 5)_
- However close we might be, Chloe was in the end another human being, with all the mystery and distance this implied, the inevitable distance embodied in the thought that we must die alone. _(loc 6)_
- Humour meant there was no need for a direct confrontation, we could glide over an irritant, winking at it obliquely, making a criticism without needing to spell it out. _(loc 7)_
- However happy we may be with our partner, our love for them necessarily hinders us from pursuing alternatives. Why should this constrain us if we love them? Why should we feel this as a loss unless our love for them has already begun to wane? Because in resolving our need to love, we do not always succeed in resolving our need to long. _(loc 8)_
- What curse did I labour under? Nothing other than an inability to enjoy happy relationships, possibly the greatest misfortune known to man in modern society. _(loc 9)_
- The possibility of an alternative love story is a reminder that the life we are leading is only one of a myriad of possible lives and it is the impossibility of leading them all that plunges us into sadness. _(loc 10)_
- We tend to remain attached to a fixed view of emotions, as though a line existed between loving and not loving that could only be crossed twice, at the beginning and end of a relationship, rather than commuted across from minute to minute. _(loc 11)_
- The inability to live in the present lies in the fear of leaving the sheltered position of anticipation or memory, and so of admitting that this is the only life that one is ever likely (heavenly intervention aside) to live. _(loc 12)_
- We needed to shout at one another partly to see whether or not we could tolerate each other’s shouting. We wanted to test each other’s capacity for survival: only if we had tried in vain to destroy one another would we know we were safe. _(loc 13)_
- Ex-lovers were reminders that situations I had at one point thought to be permanent had proved not to be so. From within a relationship, there is infinite cruelty in the idea of one’s indifference towards past loves. _(loc 14)_
- One of love’s greatest drawbacks is that, for a while at least, it is in danger of making us seriously happy. _(loc 15)_
- The telephone becomes an instrument of torture in the demonic hands of a beloved who doesn’t ring. _(loc 16)_
- Desire had turned me into a relentless hunter for clues, a romantic paranoiac, reading meaning into everything. _(loc 17)_
- Every fall into love involves the triumph of hope over self-knowledge. _(loc 18)_
- To ourselves, we are after all always un-labelable. _(loc 19)_
- What did I see in her? The question came back to me later that evening in the middle of Safeway, watching Chloe at the till, enraptured by the way she went about packing the groceries into a plastic bag. The charm I detected in these trivial gestures revealed a readiness to accept almost anything as incontestable proof that she was perfect. What did I see in her? Almost everything. _(loc 1058)_

- Because only the body is open to the eye, the hope of the infatuated lover is that the soul is faithful to its casing, that the body owns an appropriate soul, that what the skin represents turns out to be what it is.

- In the oasis complex, the thirsty man imagines he sees water, palm trees, and shade not because he has evidence for the belief, but because he has a need for it.

- What is the point of this story? It merely shows that though one may be living under a delusion (love, the belief that one is an egg), if one finds the complementary part of it (another lover like Chloe under a similar delusion, a piece of toast) then all may be well. Delusions are not harmful in themselves, they only hurt when one is alone in believing in them, when one cannot create an environment in which they can be sustained. So long as both Chloe and I could preserve the yolk of love intact, what did it matter quite what the truth was? _(loc 1170)_

- A few months later, we were in a bagel shop in Brick Lane, when an elegant man in a pinstripe suit next to us in the queue silently handed Chloe a crumpled note, on which was scrawled in large letters the words: ‘I love you.’ Chloe opened the piece of paper, swallowed hard on reading it, then looked back at the man who had given it to her. But he had chosen to act as though nothing had happened and simply stared out at the street with the dignified expression of a man in a pinstripe suit.

My first reaction was bewildered anger. Why had she not said something? Was our relationship really so distant that she couldn’t wake me up even in a crisis? But my anger (only a form of jealousy) was crude, it failed to take into account what I only gradually learnt: how deep-seated and pervasive was Chloe’s inclination to suffer in silence. She would have to have been near death before waking me, for everything about her wished not to place responsibility on others. _(loc 1321)_

I feel more complicated than in the office. You’re interested in me and you understand me better, so that’s why I made it wiggly, so that it’s sort of natural.’ ‘OK, I see, so what’s this straight side?’ ‘Where?’ ‘Up in the north-west of the amoeba.’ ‘You know I never did much geography. But yeah, I think I see it. Well, you don’t understand everything about me, do you? So I thought I’d better make it more realistic.

Well, give me a moment to perfect my stranded-without-a-battery-but-extremely-horny expression.’ 14.  We made love twice on the back seat of Chloe’s Volkswagen, in between pieces of luggage and old papers.

But love itself is a dynamic fluent sentiment-connection that as electricity, through a circuit , like blood in our bodies, pulsates, accelerates , may have eventual short-circuits , may have leaks, may slow down, may be arrithmic, maybe intervened and healed when ill, but what it is not, is that it stays always the same, static, frozen in one single value , for ever.  So why, WHY, was that childish as to request a disturbing , a pattern triggering in her, ABSOLUTE and BINARY response  precisely when what was needed was containment , understanding of the ebbs and flows, of the triggers and their  consequences, ikn a moment of LOW BLOOD PRESSURE?

## The Architecture of Happiness — Alain de Botton
*Category:* supplementals
- Belief in the significance of architecture is premised on the notion that we are, for better or for worse, different people in different places – and on the conviction that it is architecture’s task to render vivid to us who we might ideally be.
- It is in dialogue with pain that many beautiful things acquire their value. Acquaintance with grief turns out to be one of the more unusual prerequisites of architectural appreciation. We might, quite aside from all other requirements, need to be a little sad before buildings can properly touch us. _(loc 1)_
- Stendhal allowed for the wide range of goals which people have pursued. Understanding that mankind would always be as conflicted about its visual tastes as about its ethical ones, he noted, ‘There are as many styles of beauty as there are visions of happiness.’ _(loc 2)_
- We depend on our surroundings obliquely to embody the moods and ideas we respect and then to remind us of them. We look to our buildings to hold us, like a kind of psychological mould, to a helpful vision of ourselves. _(loc 3)_
- Insofar as buildings speak to us, they also do so through quotation – that is, by referring to, and triggering memories of, the contexts in which we have previously seen them, their counterparts or their models. They communicate by prompting associations. _(loc 4)_
- Relying on our associative powers, architects can dimple their arches and windows and feel confident that they will be understood as references to Islam. They can line their corridors with unpainted wooden planks and dependably allude to the rustic and the unpretentious. _(loc 5)_
- What we search for in a work of architecture is not in the end so far from what we search for in a friend. The objects we describe as beautiful are versions of the people we love. _(loc 6)_
- We should know to ask at once what people would have to lack in order to see an object as beautiful and can come to understand the tenor of their deprivation even if we cannot muster enthusiasm for their choice. _(loc 7)_
- We want them to shelter us. And we want them to speak to us – to speak to us of whatever we find important and need to be reminded of. _(loc 8)_
- We need panels of gold and lapis, windows of coloured glass and gardens of immaculately raked gravel in order to stay true to the sincerest parts of ourselves. _(loc 9)_
- To describe a building as beautiful therefore suggests more than a mere aesthetic fondness; it implies an attraction to the particular way of life this structure is promoting through its roof, door handles, window frames, staircase and furnishings. A feeling of beauty is a sign that we have come upon a material articulation of certain of our ideas of a good life. _(loc 10)_
- Buildings speak – and on topics which can readily be discerned. They speak of democracy or aristocracy, openness or arrogance, welcome or threat, a sympathy for the future or a hankering for the past. _(loc 11)_
- The function of a house was, he wrote, to provide: ‘1. A shelter against heat, cold, rain, thieves and the inquisitive. A receptacle for light and sun. A certain number of cells appropriated to cooking, work, and personal life.’ _(loc 12)_
- It was Stendhal who offered the most crystalline expression of the intimate affiliation between visual taste and our values when he wrote, ‘Beauty is the promise of happiness.’ _(loc 13)_
- Our access to it is, to a humbling extent, determined by the places we happen to be in, by the colour of the bricks, the height of the ceilings and the layout of the streets. _(loc 14)_
- To speak of home in relation to a building is simply to recognise its harmony with our own prized internal song. _(loc 15)_
- The light which washed down from above had the same gentle, indirect value as the glow emanating from a shoji screen. The architect had realised, as many of his lesser colleagues had not, that this luminous effect was in no way dependent on the use of paper and wood and could be achieved just as well, and in a more enduring manner, through panes of sandblasted glass. _(loc 16)_
- Caspar Wolf, The Lauteraar Glacier, 1776 The date of the picture is significant, for it was at this point in the calendar of the Western imagination that mountains, having been dismissed for centuries as monstrous aberrations, began to exert a widespread attraction for aristocratic tourists, who found in their raw appearance and perilousness a welcome relief from the fastidiousness and gentility of their increasingly over-civilised lives at home. _(loc 17)_
- Our sense of beauty and our understanding of the nature of a good life are intertwined. _(loc 18)_
- The essence of great architecture was understood to reside in what was functionally unnecessary. _(loc 19)_

- Architecture may well possess moral messages; it simply has no power to enforce them. It offers suggestions instead of making laws. It invites, rather than orders, us to emulate its spirit and cannot prevent its own abuse. We should be kind enough not to blame buildings for our own failure to honour the advice they can only ever subtly proffer. _(loc 186)_

- We may need to have made an indelible mark on our lives, to have married the wrong person, pursued an unfulfilling career into middle age or lost a loved one before architecture can begin to have any perceptible impact on us, for when we speak of being ‘moved’ by a building, we allude to a bitter-sweet feeling of contrast between the noble qualities written into a structure and the sadder wider reality within which we know them to exist. A lump rises in our throat at the sight of beauty from an implicit knowledge that the happiness it hints at is the exception. _(loc 205)_

- the Pyrenean ibex, or bucardo, a subspecies of wild mountain goat whose few remaining members had been confined to a national park in northern Spain. The species had become extinct in January 2000, when the very last living member, a thirteen-year-old female named Celia, was crushed to death by a falling tree. Consequently the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) formally changed the conservation status of the species from EW, which meant “extinct in the wild,” to EX, which meant “extinct,” period. Extinction, supposedly, was forever. _(loc 243)_

- This could be done by means of MAGE technology—multiplex automated genome engineering. MAGE is sort of a mass-scale, accelerated version of genetic engineering. Whereas genetic engineering works by making genetic changes manually on a few nucleotides at a time, MAGE introduces them on a wholesale basis in automated fashion. _(loc 268)_

- The same technique would work for the Neanderthal, except that you’d start with a stem cell genome from a human adult and gradually reverse-engineer it into the Neanderthal genome or a reasonably close equivalent. These stem cells can produce tissues and organs. If society becomes comfortable with cloning and sees value in true human diversity, then the whole Neanderthal creature itself could be cloned by a surrogate mother chimp—or by an extremely adventurous female _(loc 277)_

- Paradigms – the ways in which the world and its social and physical phenomena are comprehended – are not something we are born with.

For Morin (1992a) then, the paradigm of complexity is not about correctly understanding either the parts or the whole but integrating these into an ‘active loop’ that works in a circulatory fashion: … diversity organises unity which organises … diversity organises unity which organises … diversity organises unity which organises … (p. 374). _(loc 448)_

- mere acknowledgement of knowledge as a vehicle for change; it is a deep-seated apprehension that one’s existence is inexorably governed by different knowledges always competing for legitimacy and power, and that this competing is not an objective affair but an inherently human occurrence. Knowledge is a post-existential problem because it is no longer a matter for the specialist philosopher or the disciplinary expert, who are viewed through a postdisciplinary lens as limited by their disciplinary habitus. Knowledge is a postdisciplinary and post-existential problem, because nothing is neat and stable in what have been described as post-postmodern (Nealon, 2012), metamodern (Vermeulen & van den Akker, 2010) and digimodern (Kirby, 2009) landscapes in which knowledge (and thus action) is at once ecological, environmental, gendered, political, economic and multi-spiritual. _(loc 538)_
