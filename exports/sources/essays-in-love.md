# Essays in Love — Alain de Botton
_Category:_ supplementals

- The most attractive are not those who allow us to kiss them at once (we soon feel ungrateful) or those who never allow us to kiss them (we soon forget them), but those who know how carefully to administer varied doses of hope and despair.
- Perhaps it is true that we do not really exist until there is someone there to see us existing, we cannot properly speak until there is someone there who can understand what we are saying, in essence, we are not wholly alive until we are loved. _(loc 1)_
- It is no wonder that the concept of a God who can see us has been central to many religions: to be seen is to be assured that we exist, all the better if one is dealing with a God (or partner) who loves us. _(loc 2)_
- Lovers cannot remain philosophers for long, they should give way to the religious impulse, which is to believe and have faith, as opposed to the philosophic impulse, which is to doubt and enquire. They should prefer the risk of being wrong and in love to being in doubt and without love. _(loc 3)_
- One has to go into relationships with equal expectations, ready to give as much as the other – not with one person wanting a fling and the other real love. I think that’s where all the agony comes from.’ _(loc 4)_
- We might define maturity as the ability to give everyone what they deserve when they deserve it, to separate the emotions that belong and should be restricted to oneself from those that should at once be expressed to their initiators rather than passed on to later and more innocent arrivals. We were often not mature. _(loc 5)_
- However close we might be, Chloe was in the end another human being, with all the mystery and distance this implied, the inevitable distance embodied in the thought that we must die alone. _(loc 6)_
- Humour meant there was no need for a direct confrontation, we could glide over an irritant, winking at it obliquely, making a criticism without needing to spell it out. _(loc 7)_
- However happy we may be with our partner, our love for them necessarily hinders us from pursuing alternatives. Why should this constrain us if we love them? Why should we feel this as a loss unless our love for them has already begun to wane? Because in resolving our need to love, we do not always succeed in resolving our need to long. _(loc 8)_
- What curse did I labour under? Nothing other than an inability to enjoy happy relationships, possibly the greatest misfortune known to man in modern society. _(loc 9)_
- The possibility of an alternative love story is a reminder that the life we are leading is only one of a myriad of possible lives and it is the impossibility of leading them all that plunges us into sadness. _(loc 10)_
- We tend to remain attached to a fixed view of emotions, as though a line existed between loving and not loving that could only be crossed twice, at the beginning and end of a relationship, rather than commuted across from minute to minute. _(loc 11)_
- The inability to live in the present lies in the fear of leaving the sheltered position of anticipation or memory, and so of admitting that this is the only life that one is ever likely (heavenly intervention aside) to live. _(loc 12)_
- We needed to shout at one another partly to see whether or not we could tolerate each other’s shouting. We wanted to test each other’s capacity for survival: only if we had tried in vain to destroy one another would we know we were safe. _(loc 13)_
- Ex-lovers were reminders that situations I had at one point thought to be permanent had proved not to be so. From within a relationship, there is infinite cruelty in the idea of one’s indifference towards past loves. _(loc 14)_
- One of love’s greatest drawbacks is that, for a while at least, it is in danger of making us seriously happy. _(loc 15)_
- The telephone becomes an instrument of torture in the demonic hands of a beloved who doesn’t ring. _(loc 16)_
- Desire had turned me into a relentless hunter for clues, a romantic paranoiac, reading meaning into everything. _(loc 17)_
- Every fall into love involves the triumph of hope over self-knowledge. _(loc 18)_
- To ourselves, we are after all always un-labelable. _(loc 19)_
- What did I see in her? The question came back to me later that evening in the middle of Safeway, watching Chloe at the till, enraptured by the way she went about packing the groceries into a plastic bag. The charm I detected in these trivial gestures revealed a readiness to accept almost anything as incontestable proof that she was perfect. What did I see in her? Almost everything. _(loc 1058)_

- It is easy enough to find charm in a pair of eyes or the contours of a well-shaped mouth. How much harder to detect it in the movements of a woman’s hand across a supermarket checkout. _(loc 1067)_

- I was reminded of the way that Will’s question had made the distinction between qualities that belonged to a person and those ascribed to them by their lover. He had carefully asked me not who Chloe was, but more accurately, what I saw in her. _(loc 1084)_
  
  ↳ **Note:** Is it hers Or is it my idea of her

- Because only the body is open to the eye, the hope of the infatuated lover is that the soul is faithful to its casing, that the body owns an appropriate soul, that what the skin represents turns out to be what it is. I did not love Chloe for her body, I loved her body for the promise of who she was. It was a most inspiring promise. _(loc 1105)_

- In the oasis complex, the thirsty man imagines he sees water, palm trees, and shade not because he has evidence for the belief, but because he has a need for it. Desperate needs bring about a hallucination of their solution: thirst hallucinates water, the need for love hallucinates a prince or princess. The oasis complex is never a complete delusion: the man in the desert does see something on the horizon. _(loc 1118)_
  
  ↳ **Note:** Need creates the hallucination of the solution - craving creates anguish

- Doubt is easy when it is not a matter of survival: we are as sceptical as we can afford to be, and it is easiest to be sceptical about things that do not fundamentally sustain us. It is easy to doubt the existence of a table, it is hell to doubt the legitimacy of love. _(loc 1133)_
  
  ↳ **Note:** The philosopher dilemma: question anything BUT that which sustains my life LOVE

- Lovers cannot remain philosophers for long, they should give way to the religious impulse, which is to believe and have faith, as opposed to the philosophic impulse, which is to doubt and enquire. They should prefer the risk of being wrong and in love to being in doubt and without love. _(loc 1154)_
  
  ↳ **Note:** When anxiety of certain and secured  affection, there is a compulsion to accept and even normalize "untruths", "wrongdoings", consciously but convinced and commited

- one should never ask a lover, Does this love-stuffed person actually exist or are you simply imagining them? _(loc 1163)_
  
  ↳ **Note:** Why is there that preconcious notion of the lover as "more than human", "anove humanity", which enthralls all the virtues yet also all the flaws and imperfections. Aren't we enloved with them "precisely" because of that specific combination of lights and shades? The lights that shine on them and signal paths and truths to us, and the shades that offer challenges and opportunities for us to contribute ?

- What is the point of this story? It merely shows that though one may be living under a delusion (love, the belief that one is an egg), if one finds the complementary part of it (another lover like Chloe under a similar delusion, a piece of toast) then all may be well. Delusions are not harmful in themselves, they only hurt when one is alone in believing in them, when one cannot create an environment in which they can be sustained. So long as both Chloe and I could preserve the yolk of love intact, what did it matter quite what the truth was? _(loc 1170)_
  
  ↳ **Note:** Was it just me? the yolk of love is not a single individual creation,  invention, ambition, it only exists when it is a CONSTRUCTION, and that requires Cooperation, Communication, Convergence, Consensus.

- Watching a cube of sugar dissolve into a cup of camomile tea, Chloe, whose company I relied upon to make my life meaningful, remarked, ‘We can’t move in together because of my problem: I have to live on my own or else I melt. It’s not that I don’t want you, it’s that I’m afraid of wanting only you, of finding that there’s nothing left of me. So excuse it as part of my general screwed-upness, but I’m afraid I have to stay a bag lady.’ _(loc 1176)_
  
  ↳ **Note:** The fcear of dissolving into the relationship. Tje fear of yielding yourself into the us, the fear of being absorbed, or worst, changed, modified , replaced by a more comfortable version of you for that significant other one, but loosing your YOU, ikn tje process

- Habits began to leak between us: I acquired Chloe’s need for total darkness in the bedroom, she followed my way of folding the newspaper, I took to wandering in circles around the sofa to think a problem through, she acquired a taste for lying on the carpet. 4.  Diffusion brought with it intimacy. The borders between us ceased to be strictly patrolled. Our bodies no longer felt watched or judged. Chloe _(loc 1188)_
  
  ↳ **Note:** Habits that leak from one to the other, cam be imposed or can be learmings. Cam generate trauma of enlightment, pain or happiness

- A few months later, we were in a bagel shop in Brick Lane, when an elegant man in a pinstripe suit next to us in the queue silently handed Chloe a crumpled note, on which was scrawled in large letters the words: ‘I love you.’ Chloe opened the piece of paper, swallowed hard on reading it, then looked back at the man who had given it to her. But he had chosen to act as though nothing had happened and simply stared out at the street with the dignified expression of a man in a pinstripe suit. So just as innocently, Chloe folded the note and slipped it into her pocket. _(loc 1245)_
  
  ↳ _Highlighted at:_ 2025-09-27T04:56:00Z
- In restaurants, we would occasionally silently slip one another notes with all the mystery of the man in the bagel shop, but with only the message Please pass the salt written on them. For anyone watching, it must have seemed odd and incomprehensible to see us collapsing into giggles. But the essence of leitmotifs is that they refer back to incidents others cannot understand because they were absent from the founding scene. No _(loc 1251)_
  
  ↳ **Note:** The  constrution of febble and sometimes apparently temporal structures of  complicity and intimacy, begin to silently build indelible foundations of an inner world, not free from flawed or.darker  corners, but indeed a world visible and palpable only to those who have lived and contributed to its inception , even if as passive witnesses, but complicitely sharing that secret moment together
  
  ↳ _Highlighted at:_ 2025-09-27T04:56:00Z
- However slight these leitmotifs were, they acted like cement. The language of intimacy they helped to create was a reminder that (without clearing our way through jungles, slaying dragons, or even sharing apartments) Chloe and I had created something of a world together. _(loc 1264)_
  
  ↳ **Note:** The foundations of a construction -love  relationship- yet to be erected over and within this secret , internal, invisible yet powerful Two People world

- Perhaps it is true that we do not really exist until there is someone there to see us existing, we cannot properly speak until there is someone there who can understand what we are saying, in essence, we are not wholly alive until we are loved. _(loc 1278)_
  
  ↳ **Note:** Until someone can see what we see, understand what we say, feel what we feel, someone that can see inside of us and through our shields , have we really, honestly , truly existed. Or have we wandered through life and relations somehow.dimmed and faded , perhaps saddened or perhaps hopeful , feeling that there, somewhere, there might be more? A shiniest, brightest, serene "place"?

- It is no coincidence if, semantically speaking, love and interest are almost interchangeable, ‘I love butterflies’ meaning much the same as ‘I am interested in butterflies’. To love someone is to take a deep interest in them, and by such concern to bring them to a richer sense of what they are doing and saying. Through her understanding, Chloe’s behaviour towards _(loc 1291)_
  
  ↳ **Note:** What do you see in her ? The promise of.learning about the facets, the many "hers", her gestures and expressions as much as her reasoning rationale and her profound beliefs , the promise of growing myself through standing next to someone I am learning these new things. The promise of humbly contributing back some sparse fragments, that we can use to build this world of ours

- One morning in my flat, as we were having breakfast, she told me she had been ill in the night, had crept out of bed and driven to a chemist, all without waking me up. My first reaction was bewildered anger. Why had she not said something? Was our relationship really so distant that she couldn’t wake me up even in a crisis? But my anger (only a form of jealousy) was crude, it failed to take into account what I only gradually learnt: how deep-seated and pervasive was Chloe’s inclination to suffer in silence. She would have to have been near death before waking me, for everything about her wished not to place responsibility on others. _(loc 1321)_
  
  ↳ **Note:** This SURVIVAL MOOD operates in different layers and different modes. It can stop you from.asking for help when desperately needed  to quiet things in order to prevent attention to the matter and the concern and intrusion of others offering help or solutions. Sometimes it can also be misplaced or misunderstood as strength, self capacity of resolving every thing on your own, by yourself, as if that reinforced your true worth, as if that was the only.way to.become stronger and mature. Become the adult you desire to be.

- Once I had located this strand in her nature, other aspects could be understood as related manifestations of it: her lack of acknowledged anger towards her parents (an anger that allowed itself expression only in savage irony), her self-deprecation, her harshness towards self-pitying people, her sense of duty, even her way of crying (muted sobs rather than hysterical wailing). _(loc 1326)_
  
  ↳ **Note:** The silenced anger from abuse quieted through minimization, blunt denial, and progressive normalization of the trauma inflicted and the scars left. The absent adult responsible reaction, the craving for help and acknowledgement, the desperate child necesity to be seen and heard.  thbe quiet sobbing as the ultimate impotent manifestation of the inevitability of the lone, quiet , victim's path: survive by yourself, become resistant amd resilient, without the need for other

- Everyone returns us to a different sense of ourselves, for we become a little of who they think we are. Our selves could be compared to an amoeba, whose outer walls are elastic, and therefore adapt to the environment. It is not that the amoeba has no dimensions, simply that it has no self-defined shape. It is my absurdist side that an absurdist person will _(loc 1339)_
  
  ↳ **Note:** The many "I, me, Myself" that each of us show to every other one, who in turn, returm a vision, a definition of who we are for.each of them , a collection of Lines amd shapes that we slowly piece together as "how I am" to them, and to.which we slowly start reacting by.adapting and comforming or by refusing and rebelling against. The pass from. Child to Adult (not related at all with age, but with status of self realization and relations)

- Children are always described from a third-person perspective (‘Isn’t Chloe a cute/ugly/intelligent/stupid kid?’) before they gain the ability to influence their own definitions. Overcoming childhood could be understood as an attempt to correct the false stories of others. But the struggle against distortion continues beyond childhood. Most people get us wrong, either out of neglect or prejudice. _(loc 1355)_
  
  ↳ **Note:** The piecing together of the lines and shapes others describe of us, stays with is past childhood, but gets renewed in every new environment , every new relatgionship. Particularly in the most meaningful ones, such as family ties and lovers

- When I told Chloe my idea that people’s personalities in relationships were a bit like amoebas, she laughed and told me she’d loved drawing amoebas at school. ‘Here, give me the newspaper,’ she said, reaching in her bag for a pencil. ‘I’ll draw you the difference between what shape my amoeba-self has at the office and what shape it has with you.’ Then she drew the following: ‘What are all the wiggly bits?’ I asked. ‘Oh, that’s because I feel wiggly around you.’ ‘What?’ ‘Well, you know, you give me space. I feel more complicated than in the office. You’re interested in me and you understand me better, so that’s why I made it wiggly, so that it’s sort of natural.’ ‘OK, I see, so what’s this straight side?’ ‘Where?’ ‘Up in the north-west of the amoeba.’ ‘You know I never did much geography. But yeah, I think I see it. Well, you don’t understand everything about me, do you? So I thought I’d better make it more realistic. The straight line is all the sides of me you don’t understand or don’t have time for and stuff.’ ‘Oh.’ ‘Christ, don’t make that long face, you wouldn’t want to know what could happen if that line went squiggly! And don’t worry, if it was that serious, I wouldn’t be squidged here with you being such a happy amoeba.’ _(loc 1361)_
  
  ↳ **Note:** What xo I see in her returns a mirror, a sharp and hard one what xdoes she sees in me?  I can feel socft and curvaceous and even wigly and out of "proper" shape when I'm with her, but she may see me as straight and squarish from her side of the mirror,  How much does each others construction of the other, strongly influenced by their memories and remembered shapes of others, previous, old, relations, distort this mirror, as those who made you look thinner thban you are, shorter than you are , wider than you really are?. How can we, through love, and with love, correct those mirror distortion to obtain a clean almost transparent clear.glass into oir beloved one self? Is it at all possible? Is it love always a color that stains the glass, amd the result of our accumulated experiences? Do each of us have a particular color map that stains our lenses every time we enter love? Can we rebuild such color map?

- me. I looked at her face and heard her voice without the dulling blanket of familiarity, I saw her as she might strike a leather-clad mechanic, I saw her stripped of the normalizing influence of time. 12.  As a result, I was overcome by an urge to tear off her grey-green cardigan and make passionate love to her on the motorway embankment. The disruption of habit had made Chloe unknown and exotic again, desirable like a woman I had never touched, even though she had only that morning walked around my flat naked without arousing any wish in me beyond that of finishing an article I had begun reading on macro-economics in the developing world. _(loc 1478)_

- It took the AA man a few minutes to locate the fault, something to do with the battery (‘You want to watch your levels, darling,’ he had called out to Chloe from behind the bonnet), and we were ready to continue to Winchester. But my desire signalled otherwise. ‘Imagine that you’ve broken down by the side of the road and I’m this leather-clad stranger who wants to take off your clothes and take you roughly on the embankment, lifting up your innocent flowery skirt and handling you without mercy.’ ‘Are you sure?’ ‘With all my loins.’ ‘Christ, OK. Well, give me a moment to perfect my stranded-without-a-battery-but-extremely-horny expression.’ 14.  We made love twice on the back seat of Chloe’s Volkswagen, in between pieces of luggage and old papers. Though welcome, our sudden and unpredictable ecstasy, the grasping at one another’s clothes and the imaginative scenarios (I adopted a Scottish accent for the roadside tryst, she played at being married-but-looking), were _(loc 1483)_

- Chloe and I had a joke between us which acknowledged the intermittences of the heart, and eased the demand that love’s light burn with the constancy of an electric bulb. ‘Is something wrong? Do you not like me today?’ one of us would ask. ‘I like you less.’ ‘Really, much less?’ ‘No, not that much.’ ‘Out of ten?’ ‘Today? Oh, probably six and a half or, no, perhaps more six and three-quarters. And how about with you with me?’ ‘God, I’d say around minus three, though it might have been around twelve and a half earlier this morning when you . . .’ _(loc 1494)_

- We tend to remain attached to a fixed view of emotions, as though a line existed between loving and not loving that could only be crossed twice, at the beginning and end of a relationship, rather than commuted across from minute to minute. But in reality, in only a day, I might go around every available emotional dish on my inner Chinese platter. I might feel that Chloe was: 17.  I was not alone in my erratic moods, for there were times when Chloe too would unexpectedly display bursts of aggression or frustration. Discussing a film with friends one night, she swerved into a hostile speech about my ‘consistently patronizing’ attitudes towards other people. I was at first baffled, for I had not even said anything,… _(loc 1503)_
  
  ↳ **Note:** The notions of ABSOLUTE IN and ABSOLUTE OUT.  Why do we need, do we have these compulsions for Absolute Certainty?  Is it the Child inside, the one that in fear and impotent CRAVES Safety , Security, Nurishment, Contention, Company, feeling Cared for and Loved?  Is it the father/mother that CRAVES Fulfilling its Role, providing , Securing , Saving, Feeding, Containing , Accompanying , giving it ALL  to make sure the Child feels cared for and very much loved?  Why do.we get stuck with these ABSOLUTES , that in fact don't fully exist in reality but fluctuate in time and through places and situations?   isn't more true to the real nature of love that is is much more free of this dicotomic, binary vision, of absolutes?   Yes, there is love, and there is no-love.  But love itself is a dynamic fluent sentiment-connection that as electricity, through a circuit , like blood in our bodies, pulsates, accelerates , may have eventual short-circuits , may have leaks, may slow down, may be arrithmic, maybe intervened and healed when ill, but what it is not, is that it stays always the same, static, frozen in one single value , for ever.  So why, WHY, was that childish as to request a disturbing , a pattern triggering in her, ABSOLUTE and BINARY response  precisely when what was needed was containment , understanding of the ebbs and flows, of the triggers and their  consequences, ikn a moment of LOW BLOOD PRESSURE?

  ↳ **Note:** How many times does this happen not from.a morning incident at work transfered to tje evening dinner with  our partner , but rather years, perhaps decades later, when we subconciously detect or sometimes project a connection with.that irritating or painful.event. Pushing full force, bluntly am blindly ahead, towards an unaware individual -disconnected with the source of anger or pain- because something in tje wording, the tone, the circumstances, the place … ttiggered su uncontrollable unavoidable unmodulated reaction.

- If philosophers have traditionally advocated a life lived according to reason, condemning in its name a life led by desire, it is because reason is a bedrock of continuity.

- We also found comfort in planning the future. Because there was a threat that love might end as suddenly as it had begun, we tried to reinforce the present through an appeal to a common destiny. We dreamt of where we would live and how many children we would have, we identified ourselves with the wrinkled couples taking their grandchildren for walks and holding hands in Kensington Gardens. Defending ourselves against love’s demise, we took pleasure in planning a mutual future in precise detail. There _(loc 1541)_

  ↳ **Note:** Accepting love as a commitment to give yourself, parts of you to other , and receiving parts and pieces okf your loved one , to cherish , to protect , tok worship even, to care for, imply inevitably the establishment of an interdependence. And that notion of dependence , from someone May very well induce the most fulfilling happiness or invoke your darkest fears.

- Proust tells the story of Mohammed II who, sensing that he was falling in love with one of the wives in his harem, at once had her killed because he did not wish to live in spiritual bondage to another. Short of this, I had long ago given up hopes of achieving self-sufficiency. I had gone out of my room, and begun to love another – thereby taking on the risk inseparable from basing one’s life around another human being. _(loc 1671)_
  
  ↳ **Note:** Should I "kill" her to avoid accepting that, inlove as I am, I relinquish my absolute independence to the reality of my love for her , hence my physical and emotional and spirtitual.bondage to her?

- The desire is that I be loved even if I lose everything: leaving nothing but ‘me’, this mysterious ‘me’ taken to be the self at its weakest, most vulnerable point. Do you love me enough that I may be weak with you? Everyone loves strength, but Do you love me for my weakness? That is the real test. Do you love me stripped of everything that might be lost, for only the things I will have for ever? _(loc 1733)_
  
  ↳ **Note:** And every time we delved deep into conversation about us, about me or her or us that is, she would request to get deeper into my past, look closer at my scars, request me to unveil wounds I have buried deep down and far in order to move on and ahead

- The essence of Kant’s theory is that morality is to be found exclusively in the motive from which an act is performed. To love someone is moral only when that love is given free of any expected return, if that love is given simply for the sake of giving love. _(loc 2043)_
  
  ↳ **Note:** Love without expecting retribution

- Dead so as to be able to show the world in general, and Chloe in particular, how angry I was, and alive, so as to be able to see the effect that I had had on Chloe and hence be released from my anger. It was not a question of being or not being. My answer to Hamlet _(loc 2206)_

- By the third chapter, Dr Nearly had identified the roots of the problem as lying in deficient parents, who had given these unfortunate romantics a warped understanding of the affective process. If they had never loved people who were nice to them, it was because their earliest emotional attachments had taught them that love should be unreciprocated and cruel. _(loc 2407)_
  
  ↳ **Note:** The embedded and embodied models of love learnt while growing from child to.adult, embossed a pattern with which one searches and measures each potential partner , a kind of metric, to evaluate its fitness to our.need to.repeat known patterns of love engraved in our minds and hearts

- but there is a great difference between identifying a problem and solving it, between wisdom and the wise life. We are all more intelligent than we are capable, and awareness of the insanity of love has never saved anyone from the disease. _(loc 2456)_

- If romantic positivism could be of no help, then the only valid wisdom was the stoic advice never to fall in love again. I would henceforth retreat from the world, see no one, live frugally, and throw myself into austere study. I read with admiration stories of men and women who had escaped earthly distractions, made vows of chastity, and spent their lives in monasteries and nunneries. _(loc 2463)_
  
  ↳ **Note:** I know this, I once thought it was my time and my path. But love is the flame of life, atg least for a positivist romantic like me. I can't live without loving and without feeling love. Hopefully also feeling loved back in retribution .

- I realized that a more complex lesson needed to be drawn, one that could play with the incompatibilities of love, juggling the need for wisdom with its likely impotence, juggling the idiocy of infatuation with its inevitability. Love had to be appreciated without flight into dogmatic optimism or pessimism, without constructing a philosophy of one’s fears, or a morality of one’s disappointments. _(loc 2487)_
  
  ↳ **Note:** Unreasonable and inevitable , temporarily wise but completely derngwd at others , love is a juggling exercise of oir whole.fragile humanity risked on the verge of self sacrifice for the sake of a promise: we will be happy together .
