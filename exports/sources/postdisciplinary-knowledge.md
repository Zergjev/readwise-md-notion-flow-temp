# Postdisciplinary Knowledge — Tomas Pernecky
_Category:_ books

- Paradigms – the ways in which the world and its social and physical phenomena are comprehended – are not something we are born with. Rather, one’s capacity to grasp the world grows and develops though exposure to people, lived experiences, ideas, textbooks, education, institutional culture and so forth. _(loc 389)_

- What postdisciplinarity has to say about knowledge, then, is that we ‘encounter ourselves’ through research and as makers of knowledge. _(loc 395)_

- It may then present itself, albeit not exclusively, as: a tendency to break disciplinary habitus (Bourdieu, 2004): when framed by a discipline, or across a number of disciplines, research is shaped by cultural practices which are always ‘at work’, so to speak, arranging objects, people and research problems in distinct ways; and hence also as: _(loc 398)_

- a recognition that there are different ways in which we meaningfully make sense of our worlds (i.e. ontological, epistemological, methodological and semantic pluralism); therefore, arming the enquirer with: _(loc 401)_

- an anti-conformist effort that views the questions of validity and legitimacy not as something to be determined institutionally or through disciplinary agreement but by recognising the researcher as a valued knowledge maker, capable of academic fluency and intellectual insight. _(loc 404)_

- Postdisciplinarity can further arise as: a worldmaking force3 that is proficient in making, re-making and de-making social realities; an anti-reductionist undertaking that renders problematic any attempt to reduce human experience to a set of generalisable, descriptive facts; a fluid process as opposed to a completed activity, due to the dynamic character of social and global problems; a liberated mode of imagination and curiosity that advances academic freedom and flexibility to see, do and be anew or a critico-probing activity that examines the processes of reification of social and institutional facts (e.g. what is socially constructed by whom and for what reasons). _(loc 406)_

- STRAIN 1: Complexity-driven approaches fuelled by transforming existing knowledges through establishing new links and connections in order to find solutions to contemporary challenges facing different communities around the world. STRAIN 2: Critical, emancipatory, equitable and transformatory knowledge acts that aim to unleash/unveil/disrupt the ways in which knowledge can be both oppressive and libertarian. STRAIN 3: A form of post-existentialism whereby knowledge is understood fundamentally as an existential problem – a predicament from which there is no escape for the average human being. STRAIN 4: Departures from the what, why and how of knowledge that seek to challenge and reconfigure fixed assumptions at the levels of ontology, epistemology and methodology. _(loc 418)_

- The first strain builds upon the critique of disciplinary knowledge and the calls for holistic and integrative approaches. One of the chief concerns in this region is that many of the problems societies face today are rarely discipline specific, and therefore, disciplines provide only a partial picture. _(loc 435)_

- Seidman (2017) is among those voices to have emphasised that to talk of social inequality, power and racial injustice, for instance, demands that one is skilled enough to be able to draw on a variety of theoretical perspectives, which may range from classical sociology and poststructuralism to feminism and cultural studies. In his view, the ‘old-style grand theorizing’ (p. 306) _(loc 437)_

- Underpinning his critique of General System Theory, Morin (1992a) further argues that systems theory has failed to articulate the concept of system and falls ‘repeatedly into the reductive, simplifactory, mutilating, and manipulative ruts from which it was supposed to have freed itself (and us along with it)’ (p. 372). For Morin (1992a) then, the paradigm of complexity is not about correctly understanding either the parts or the whole but integrating these into an ‘active loop’ that works in a circulatory fashion: … diversity organises unity which organises … diversity organises unity which organises … diversity organises unity which organises … (p. 374). _(loc 448)_

- Overall, postdisciplinary research within this strain views reductionism in both forms – to the individual components and to the whole – as failing to see the crux of complexity. _(loc 468)_

- mere acknowledgement of knowledge as a vehicle for change; it is a deep-seated apprehension that one’s existence is inexorably governed by different knowledges always competing for legitimacy and power, and that this competing is not an objective affair but an inherently human occurrence. Knowledge is a post-existential problem because it is no longer a matter for the specialist philosopher or the disciplinary expert, who are viewed through a postdisciplinary lens as limited by their disciplinary habitus. Knowledge is a postdisciplinary and post-existential problem, because nothing is neat and stable in what have been described as post-postmodern (Nealon, 2012), metamodern (Vermeulen & van den Akker, 2010) and digimodern (Kirby, 2009) landscapes in which knowledge (and thus action) is at once ecological, environmental, gendered, political, economic and multi-spiritual. _(loc 538)_
