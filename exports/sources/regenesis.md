- It reproduced itself every twenty minutes, so that theoretically, given enough simple food and stirring, a single particle of E. coli could multiply itself exponentially into a mass greater than the earth in less than two days. _(loc 183)_

- stripped 15 percent of its natural genes from the K-12 genome, making it a sort of reduced instruction set organism, a streamlined, purer version of the microbe. Blattner described it as “rationally designed _(loc 188)_

- the Pyrenean ibex, or bucardo, a subspecies of wild mountain goat whose few remaining members had been confined to a national park in northern Spain. The species had become extinct in January 2000, when the very last living member, a thirteen-year-old female named Celia, was crushed to death by a falling tree. Consequently the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) formally changed the conservation status of the species from EW, which meant “extinct in the wild,” to EX, which meant “extinct,” period. Extinction, supposedly, was forever. _(loc 243)_

- This could be done by means of MAGE technology—multiplex automated genome engineering. MAGE is sort of a mass-scale, accelerated version of genetic engineering. Whereas genetic engineering works by making genetic changes manually on a few nucleotides at a time, MAGE introduces them on a wholesale basis in automated fashion. _(loc 268)_

- The same technique would work for the Neanderthal, except that you’d start with a stem cell genome from a human adult and gradually reverse-engineer it into the Neanderthal genome or a reasonably close equivalent. These stem cells can produce tissues and organs. If society becomes comfortable with cloning and sees value in true human diversity, then the whole Neanderthal creature itself could be cloned by a surrogate mother chimp—or by an extremely adventurous female _(loc 277)_

- Today we are at the point in science and technology where we humans can reduplicate and then improve what nature has already accomplished. We too can turn the inorganic into the organic. We too can read and interpret genomes—as well as modify them. And we too can create genetic diversity, adding to the considerable sum of it that nature has already produced. _(loc 284)_

- The order of the atoms and their shape matters. Water is not H-H-O but rather H-O-H, meaning that each hydrogen atom can only bind to the oxygen atom, and not to two atoms. _(loc 363)_

- These rearranged molecules are called isomers of each other (Greek for “the same parts”). Ethanol is an isomer of dimethyl ether: each molecule has two carbons, six hydrogens, and one oxygen, but differently arranged. _(loc 375)_

- Berzelius was also the first to recognize the difference between organic compounds that were derived only from living matter, and all other chemicals, which he lumped together as “inorganic.” This distinction contributed greatly to our understanding of life _(loc 382)_
