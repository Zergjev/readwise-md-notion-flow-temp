# Buddhism Without Beliefs — Stephen Batchelor
_Category:_ supplementals

- Self-confidence is not a form of arrogance. It is trust in our capacity to awaken. It is both the courage to face whatever life throws at us without losing equanimity, and the humility to treat every situation we encounter as one from which we can learn.
- Dharma practice is founded on resolve. This is not an emotional conversion, a devastating realization of the error of our ways, a desperate urge to be good, but an ongoing, heartfelt reflection on priorities, values, and purpose. We need to keep taking stock of our life in an unsentimental, uncompromising way. _(loc 1)_
- Agnosticism is no excuse for indecision. If anything, it is a catalyst for action; for in shifting concern away from a future life and back to the present, it demands an ethics of empathy rather than a metaphysics of fear and hope. _(loc 2)_
- Letting go of a craving is not rejecting it but allowing it to be itself: a contingent state of mind that once arisen will pass away. _(loc 3)_
- We do not receive wisdom, we must discover it for ourselves, after a journey through the wilderness, which no one else can make for us, which no one can spare us, for our wisdom is the point of view from which we come at last to regard the world. _(loc 4)_
- To understand a worry is to know it calmly and clearly for what it is: transient, contingent, and devoid of intrinsic identity. _(loc 5)_
- The challenge of the first truth is to act before habitual reactions incapacitate us. _(loc 6)_
- The task of awareness is to catch the impulse at its inception, to notice the very first hint of resentment coloring our feelings and perceptions. But such precision requires a focused mind. _(loc 7)_
- The four ennobling truths are not propositions to believe; they are challenges to act. _(loc 8)_
- ANGUISH EMERGES FROM craving for life to be other than it is. _(loc 9)_
- Dharma practice starts not with belief in a transcendent reality but through embracing the anguish experienced in an uncertain world. _(loc 10)_
- Anguish emerges from craving for life to be other than it is. It is the symptom of flight from birth and death, from the pulse of the present. It is the gnawing mood of unease that haunts the clinging to “me” and “mine.” _(loc 11)_
- Integrity entails not merely refraining from overt acts of this kind, but also recognizing how we contemplate such behavior in our thoughts, repeat it through fantasy, or prepare for it even though we lose our nerve before carrying it out. _(loc 12)_
- Over time such meditation penetrates our primary sense of being in the world at all. It helps us value more deeply our relationships with others, whom we come to regard as transient as ourselves. It evokes the poignancy implicit in the transitoriness of all things. _(loc 13)_
- A compassionate heart still feels anger, greed, jealousy, and other such emotions. But it accepts them for what they are with equanimity, and cultivates the strength of mind to let them arise and pass without identifying with or acting upon them. _(loc 14)_
- One of the great realizations of the Enlightenment was that an atheistic materialist could be just as moral a person as a believer—even more so. This insight led to liberation from the constraints of ecclesiastical dogma, which was crucial in forming the sense of intellectual and political freedom we enjoy today. _(loc 15)_
- THE ACTIONS THAT accompany the four truths describe the trajectory of dharma practice: understanding anguish leads to letting go of craving, which leads to realizing its cessation, which leads to cultivating the path. _(loc 16)_
- A REFLECTION LIKE this does not tell you anything you do not already know: that death is certain and its time uncertain. The point is to consider these facts regularly and slowly, allowing them to percolate through you, until a felt-sense of their meaning and implication is awakened. _(loc 17)_
- Awakening is no longer seen as something to attain in the distant future, for it is not a thing but a process—and this process is the path itself. _(loc 18)_
- I may be able to ease the spasm of self-centeredness by realizing that I am not a fixed essence but an interactive cluster of processes. _(loc 19)_
- truths. And the crucial distinction that each truth requires _(loc 104)_

- the nature of the human dilemma and a way to its resolution. The first two truths (anguish and its origins) describe the dilemma, the second two (cessation and the path) its resolution. He awoke to a set of interrelated truths rooted in the immediacy of experience here and now. _(loc 122)_

- If we try to avoid a powerful wave looming above us on the beach, it will send us crashing into the sand and surf. But if we face it head-on and dive right into it, we discover only water. _(loc 148)_

- The difference between then and now is like the idea of sex and the first experience of it. On the one hand, the act is a momentous and irrevocable step; on the other hand, it is just a part of life. _(loc 183)_

- As soon as understanding is isolated from letting go, it degrades into mere intellectuality. As soon as letting go is isolated from understanding, it declines into spiritual posturing. _(loc 204)_

- THE FORCE OF the term “agnosticism” has been lost. It has come to mean: not to hold an opinion about the questions of life and death; to say “I don’t know” when you really mean “I don’t want to know.” When allied (and confused) with atheism, it has become part of the attitude that legitimizes an indulgent consumerism and the unreflective conformism dictated by mass media. _(loc 276)_
  
  ↳ **Note:** Thinking bout this "not wantikng to know" here byh the author but then contrzted with the version that Huxley offered, seems to me that it is not an "I don't want to know" as a resignation to knokwledge but exactly the opposite, "I want to know, but to know I need understanding and proof, so I can explain to another what I know"

- Rather than a creed, though, he saw it as a method realized through “the rigorous application of a single principle.” He expressed this principle positively as: “Follow your reason as far as it will take you,” and negatively as: “Do not pretend that conclusions are certain which are not demonstrated or demonstrable.” _(loc 280)_

- The dharma is not something to believe in but something to do. _(loc 284)_
  
  ↳ **Note:** The Dharma if we call this thw buddhist practice is then, by Buddha himself, a method and not a belief, a way of doing rather than a form of faith.

- An agnostic Buddhist looks to the dharma for metaphors of existential confrontation rather than metaphors of existential consolation. The _(loc 295)_
  
  ↳ **Note:** The confrontations of life/death, pleasure/pain, loneliness/companionship, loved/not loved.  these confrontations lead to anguish because of the confusion and impotency of not understanding, of not KNOWING.  BUT, as De Botton points out, can we really KNOW love, in the way we can philosophice about our own existence or the basis of reality?
