# The School of Life — The School of Life and Alain de Botton
_Category:_ books

- Much anxiety surrounds the question of how good the next generation will be at maths; very little around their abilities at marriage or kindness. We devote inordinate hours to learning about tectonic plates and cloud formations, and relatively few fathoming shame and rage. The assumption is that emotional insight might be either unnecessary or in essence unteachable, lying beyond reason or method, an unreproducible phenomenon best abandoned to individual instinct and intuition. We are left to find our own path around our unfeasibly complicated minds – a move as striking (and as wise) as suggesting that each generation should rediscover the laws of physics by themselves. _(loc 245)_

Does it requiere all previous learned knowledge to be studied? Is it postponed based on relevance ? Appropriate Age for studying it? Complexity? Maturity levels?
